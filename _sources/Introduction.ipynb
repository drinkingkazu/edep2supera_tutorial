    "# Introduction\n",
    "`edep2supera` is a software tool developed for the DUNE near detector (DUNE-ND) collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, it is useful to agree-on / introduce some concepts to be on the same page!\n",
    "* `lartpc_mlreco3d` is a machine learning (ML) based data reconstruction chain. The goal of `edep2supera` is to provide information necessary, called \"_labels_\", to optimize ML algorithms in `lartpc_mlreco3d` so that it can be used for the DUNE-ND data. \n",
    "* `edep2supera` requires input data that is produced from DUNE-ND simulation workflow. In particular, `edep2supera` is designed to take data files generated by `edep-sim` in the diagram below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/simulation_workflow.png\"\n",
    "     alt=\"Simulation Workflow\"\n",
    "     style=\"float: center; width:75%;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately `lartpc_mlreco3d` should be trained with `larnd-sim` output files which include realistic detector effects. The value of `edep2supera` is to provide:\n",
    "1. put a foundation of generating labels to optimize the reconstruction chain\n",
    "2. a benchmark of the reconstruction algorithms without detector effects\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, 1 is critical to ensure interpretation of simulated information is correct. This validation allows us to compare the known performance of the reconstruction chain that is trained on the equivalent stage of a simulation (i.e. without detector effects), which has been used to validate the label generation process across experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two key points to be aware: how to setup the software stack and how to run `edep-sim` in a way that is compatible with `edep2supera`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software stack \n",
    "\n",
    "`edep2supera` requires `larcv2` and `SuperaAtomic` to be installed and built. We strongly recommend users to use a Docker or Singularity software containers prepared by the maintainers of `edep2supera`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `edep-sim` file\n",
    "\n",
    "`edep2supera` (and underlying algorithms) assumes `edep-sim` is run in a certain way to maximize the level of details (and thus amount of) simulation information stored. In particular, when you run `edep-sim`, please make sure to include these lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "/edep/hitSeparation TPCActive_shape -1 mm\n",
    "/edep/hitSagitta drift 1.0 mm\n",
    "/edep/hitLength drift 1.0 mm\n",
    "/edep/db/set/neutronThreshold 0 MeV\n",
    "/edep/db/set/lengthThreshold 0 mm\n",
    "/edep/db/set/gammaThreshold 0 MeV\n",
    "/edep/random/timeRandomSeed\n",
    "/edep/update\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The most critical nature required (and enabled above) is that a generated trajectory segment (i.e. `TG4HitSegment` if you wonder) is not shared by multiple particles, and is always asssigned to a unique particle. This helps to disambiguate energy depositions that are otherwise mixed between particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## For developers\n",
    "If you are to develop the code, most likely you would want to install `SuperaAtomic` and `edep2supera`. We recommend you to use the same container described above, then locally install the developer version of these softwares.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `SuperaAtomic` Installation\n",
    "The command below will build and install `SuperaAtomic` to your local area (`$HOME/.local`) which is prioritized over the pre-installed one under the system path. \n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/DeepLearnPhysics/SuperaAtomic\n",
    "cd SuperaAtomic\n",
    "export SUPERA_WITHOUT_PYTHON=1\n",
    "python3 setup.py install --user\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note you want to set `SUPERA_WITHOUT_PYTHON=1`. Without specifying this, `SuperaAtomic` will be built with `pybind11` which would be incompatible with `edep2supera`. Don't worry: `SuperaAtomic` will still be usable in Python after you build `edep2supera`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In development, after you modify your code, simply repeat:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 setup.py install --user\n",
    "```\n",
    "(and perhaps you may also have to re-install `edep2supera` if C++ dependent source code has changed).\n",
    "\n",
    "### `edep2supera` Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, below is how you can install `edep2supera`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/DeepLearnPhysics/edep2supera\n",
    "cd edep2supera\n",
    "python3 setup.py install --user\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After you modify the source code, again simply try:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 setup.py install --user\n",
    "```"
